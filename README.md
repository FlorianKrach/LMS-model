# LMS-model
This is a repository with the entire code used to create the LMS models, plots and statistical analysis for the paper "Reference values of body composition parameters and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by DXA in adults aged 18 to 81 years â€“ results from the LEAD cohort.", published in ???. The code should be easy to understand and use for other projects including LMS model generation for body composition data of large cohorts, in particular, to generate age dependent (in a continuous manner) percentile curves which can be used as reference values.

The code is written in R.
