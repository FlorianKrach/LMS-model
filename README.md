## Description
This is a repository with the entire code used to create the LMS models, plots and statistical analysis for the paper referenced above. The code should be easy to understand and use for other projects including LMS model generation for body composition data of large cohorts, in particular, to generate age dependent (in a continuous manner) percentile curves which can be used as reference values.

The code is written in R.
